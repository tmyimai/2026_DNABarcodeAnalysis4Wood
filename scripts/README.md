1. "sortNstack.sh" was used to sort the downloaded fasta files by either matK or rbcL gene. 
2. "seqprep4fasta.sh" was used stack the sequence files of Sanger sequencing (*.fasta) into one .fas file with the reference sequence data from Chamaecyparis obtusa, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, and Thujopsis dolabrata. 
3. "refs_Hinoki01_pr15pr16.fas" is used in the script "seqprep4fasta.sh" for the reference sequence data to be stacked with the Sanger sequecnign fasta data.
